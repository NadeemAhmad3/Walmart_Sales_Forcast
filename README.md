A sophisticated machine learning project that forecasts weekly sales for Walmart stores. This repository contains the complete workflow, from data exploration and feature engineering in a Jupyter Notebook to a final, interactive web application built with Streamlit.

The core of the project is an XGBoost Regressor model, which proved to be more effective than a deep learning approach for this structured dataset, achieving a high R² score on the validation set.



🌟 Key Features of the Streamlit App

Dynamic Forecasting: Get instant sales predictions by adjusting input parameters like Store ID, Date, and various economic factors.

Confidence Score: A gauge visualizes the model's confidence based on its R² score, providing a quick measure of prediction reliability.

Feature Contribution Analysis: A waterfall chart shows how each input feature positively or negatively influences the final sales forecast.

What-If Scenarios: Interactively explore how changing a single feature (like Fuel Price or CPI) impacts sales predictions, helping to understand feature sensitivity.

Context Gauges: See where your inputs stand relative to the typical range of values in the original dataset (Low, Average, High).

Model Performance Deep Dive: Access diagnostic plots like residual analysis and prediction error distribution to understand the model's behavior on the validation data.

▶️ How to Run
1. Run the Jupyter Notebook

To explore the data analysis, feature engineering, and model training process, launch JupyterLab:

code
Bash
download
content_copy
expand_less
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
jupyter lab```

Then, open the `Walmart Sales Prediction.ipynb` notebook and run the cells.

### 2. Launch the Streamlit Web App

To start the interactive forecasting application, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py

Your web browser will automatically open to the application's local URL.

🧠 Modeling & Results

Several models were evaluated, including Linear Regression, a Deep Learning model (using TensorFlow/Keras), and an XGBoost Regressor.

XGBoost (Winner): This model performed the best, achieving an R² score of 0.92 on the time-series validation set. It demonstrated superior performance in capturing the complex, non-linear relationships in the data.

Deep Learning: A sequential neural network was also tested. While functional, it did not outperform the XGBoost model for this specific tabular dataset, highlighting that more complex models are not always better.

The final deployed application uses the saved xgb_model.joblib for its predictions.
